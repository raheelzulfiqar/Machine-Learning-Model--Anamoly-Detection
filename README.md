# Mod-5-Project---Machine-Learning
In this Project I will be going over the Lending Club Loan Data where the data is imbalanced, big and has multiple features with different data types. For the purpose of modelling, I will be taking all default loans as the target variable and will be trying to predict if a loan will default or not.
